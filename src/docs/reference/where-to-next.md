# Where to Next?

Now that you are acquainted with some applications and methods in AI, here are some places you can dive in deeper:
* [Google's Tensorflow tutorial](https://www.tensorflow.org/tutorials/)
* [Coursera's Machine Learning class taught by Andrew Ng](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
* Google's 3-hour course [Learn TensorFlow and deep learning, without a Ph.D.](https://cloud.google.com/blog/big-data/2017/01/learn-tensorflow-and-deep-learning-without-a-phd)
* Take CMU's [Introduction to Machine Learning](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~mgormley/courses/10701-f16/), followed up by [Statistical Machine Learning](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/~larry/=sml/)
* Keep up to date with [Artificial Intelligence research papers at arXiv.org](https://arxiv.org/list/cs.AI/recent)
* Check out the [latest articles about machine learning at Distill](http://distill.pub/)
* Watch technical talks from various past [Machine Learning Summer Schools](http://videolectures.net/site/search/?q=MLSS) or check out videos from the [2016 Deep Learning Summer School](http://videolectures.net/deeplearning2016_montreal/)
* Use scikit-learn, a high level Python library, to conduct machine learning. [An introduction to machine learning with scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/tutorial/basic/tutorial.html)
* Dive into the [Machine Learning For Software Engineers rabbit hole](https://github.com/ZuzooVn/machine-learning-for-software-engineers)
